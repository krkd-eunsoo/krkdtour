  <p>Last year in Seoul Innovation Park, we noticed a stray white dog walking around by himself. People gave him many names: Padeng, Whitey, Chobok, Hyuck Goo, Pita, and so on. One day someone reported him and he was taken away to the animal shelter, where he was likely to be put down. Luckily, a group of people came together to rescue him. Since that fateful day, people have come together to collectively care for this dog. These days, he is living the life of an office dog, coming to the center every morning, and going home at night.
